Welcome to Kunst

This is a an art gallery app that allows you to see a painting as it would look like in a gallery space.

You can choose from a list of paintings, add them to your user profile, then test it out inside of the gallery space.

The image rendering and manipulation is accomplished with D3.

A demo of the application can be found here:
